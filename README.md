# VMaNGOS Arena
This was one of my first Projects for VMaNGOS with almost no coding knowledge just copy paste and endless tries.
I know it's horrible coded but it works and was funny.

### What Todo
- Compile
- Copy the Maps etc from source\sql\arena
- Add source\sql\arena\world_arena.sql on your world DB
- Download Patch-3.MPQ and put it into your World of Warcraft\Data Folder: https://github.com/Oroxzy/VMaNGOSArenaPatch
- Login
- Use `.lookup object arena orb` to place the Arena Orb to queue up
- Have fun
